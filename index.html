            Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the
            existence of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so
            uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8
            billion years ago.

            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
            at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
            venturing far beyond the world of known physics. He was trying to
            understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
            should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what
            might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch
            in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space
            itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing
            the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a
            prodigiously violent instant. If true, the rapid engorgement would
            solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
            and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would
            iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were
            not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
            ocean. “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of
            the page and drew a double box around it. On Monday, Dr. Guth’s
            starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the
            beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known
            undramatically as inflation, looked right.
